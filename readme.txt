# EzyRide Backend

The **EzyRide Backend** is a Spring Boot application with a PostgreSQL database that handles taxi availability and ride request management for a transportation solution at **IIIT Nagpur**. This repository powers the mobile application built using **Flutter**, providing seamless communication and real-time updates between the app and the backend.

### My Role:
I played a significant role in implementing the backend services, including **User Authentication**, **Authorization**, and **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**. I developed the authentication and authorization mechanisms using **JWT** for secure session management and implemented detailed RBAC to restrict access based on user roles. I also integrated the backend with a PostgreSQL database to store user and ride data.

### Key Features:
- **User Authentication**: Secure user registration, login, and logout processes using **JWT** (JSON Web Token) for session management. Passwords are securely hashed and stored, ensuring strong protection against unauthorized access.

- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**:
  - Users are assigned roles (e.g., **Admin**, **User**, **Moderator**), and access to specific resources or endpoints is granted based on these roles.
  - Admin users have full access to all endpoints, while **User** and **Moderator** roles have restricted access based on permissions.

- **Authorization**:
  - Access control mechanisms ensure that only users with the correct roles can perform actions or access specific resources. Unauthorized users receive **Access Denied** responses for restricted endpoints.

- **JWT Authentication**:
  - Used for stateless user sessions across API requests. Tokens are issued after successful login and are required to access protected endpoints.

- **Secure Communication**:
  - **HTTPS** is used for secure communication between the client and server to protect sensitive data during transmission.

- **Role Permissions**:
  - Detailed permissions are implemented for each role to restrict access to specific API resources. Admins can manage users, while Users can view personal data and request rides.

- **Customizable System**:
  - The system is designed to be flexible, allowing for easy addition of new roles and permissions without significant changes to the codebase.
